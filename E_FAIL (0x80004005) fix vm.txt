If virtual box says that vt-x or and-v aren’t enabled or the vim console wrap shows
“E_FAIL (0x80004005)” even if virtualization is enabled in bios, here is how to fix it.

1. Right-click on the windows icon

2. Click windows power shell (admin)

3. Once fully pulled up type (without “) “bcdedit /set hypervisorlaunchtype Off”

4. Once is states that the operation was a success, hard reboot the computer twice (make
sure after holding the power button for more than 10 seconds and then powering it back
up again, sign into the computer and let it start up, then perform the next hard reboot)

5. If Windows, on the second reboot, states that there was a problem starting up your
computer (scared the living shit out of me), don’t panic! Just go to wherever it says
“continue to windows startup (partition 3)” click it, and you should be able to boot back to
startup.

6. Once signed in and the computer is fully setup, go to whatever kind of virtualization app
you use, attempt to start a vm, and it should work.

And that’s all the support I can add onto this situation, bye bye!
